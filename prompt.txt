
Create an interactive web-based piano simulation. Dark mode by default. 
Include at least 5 sample melodies (e.g., Für Elise, Ode to Joy, Happy Birthday, ...).
Implement "Play" buttons for each melody to demonstrate the piano's capabilities.
Ensure melodies use accurate pitch notations (e.g., E4 instead of just E).
Include clear instructions for how to use the virtual piano.

Expanded Keyboard Piano Simulation Project
Create an interactive web-based piano simulation with the following features:

Piano Interface:

Implement a virtual piano with 49 keys (4 octaves, from C2 to C6).
Each key should be clickable and respond visually when activated.
Display the note name (e.g., C4, D#3) on each key for easy reference.
Ensure the piano is scrollable to accommodate various screen sizes.


Sound Generation:

Use the Web Audio API to generate realistic piano-like tones.
Implement accurate frequencies for each note across the 4-octave range.


Playback Features:

Allow users to play the piano using mouse clicks on the virtual keys.
Implement keyboard controls, mapping computer keys (A-J for white keys, W, E, T, Y, U for black keys) to a specific octave (e.g., C3-B3).
Create a function to play predefined melodies automatically.


Sample Melodies:

Include at least three sample melodies (e.g., Für Elise, Ode to Joy, Happy Birthday).
Implement "Play" buttons for each melody to demonstrate the piano's capabilities.
Ensure melodies use accurate pitch notations (e.g., E4 instead of just E).


User Interface:

Design a dark mode interface for comfortable viewing.
Include clear instructions for how to use the virtual piano.
Add a disclaimer about the simulation's limitations.


Responsive Design:

Ensure the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
Implement a scrollable piano container to handle different screen sizes.


Educational Components:

Display note names on keys to help users learn piano layout.
Provide visual feedback (key highlighting) during melody playback to show which keys are being played.


Extensibility:

Structure the code to allow easy addition of new melodies or features.
Use dynamic key generation to facilitate future expansions of the piano range.



Challenges to consider:

Optimizing performance for smooth playback on various devices.
Improving the realism of the piano sound (e.g., implementing overtones, decay).
Adding more advanced features like recording and playback of user performances.
Implementing touch support for better mobile experience.

This project combines web development skills with basic music theory, creating an engaging and educational tool for users to explore piano playing in a digital environment.
